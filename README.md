# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains the project I worked on during my Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features using Linear Regression. The dataset contains features like square footage, number of rooms, location, etc., which are used to train the model.

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a model to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. The project was built using Linear Regression, which is a commonly used algorithm for regression tasks in Machine Learning.

Key Steps in the Project

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualized the relationships between features and the target variable (house price).
Checked for multicollinearity among the features.

3. Modeling:

Implemented Linear Regression to predict house prices.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

4. Model Evaluation:

The model was evaluated based on how well it could predict house prices on unseen data.
Fine-tuned the model and checked for overfitting/underfitting.

Conclusion

This project helped me to understand and implement the basic concepts of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and regression modeling. It was a valuable learning experience, and I gained hands-on experience in using Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
